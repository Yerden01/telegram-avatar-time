How to install:
  1. Download code or clone it: **git clone https://github.com/Yerden01/telegram-avatar-time.git**

You need linux server:

  0. I used Ubuntu 18.04
  1. Change config/config.py api data to your own. Your api data you can take here: https://my.telegram.org/apps
  2. Change timezone to yours in main.py (now it is Asia/Almaty)
  3. You have to add run.sh to write and executing access: chmod +x run.sh
  4. Then run to install all the requirements: sudo ./run.sh. 
  5. Run this and you have to enter your phone and code: python3 main.py
  6(optional). If you close terminal, it won't work, to make it work run: nohup python3 main.py
